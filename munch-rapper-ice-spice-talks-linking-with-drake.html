Like, he’s mad nice and respectful. We went to OVO Fest. It was exciting because it was like his first time performing in Toronto, I think in like a couple of years. So it was just a movie, everybody was excited. The energy was high. Nicki [Minaj] performed, it was lit. [Lil] Wayne did his thing. That shit was crazy.”</p><p>Ice Spice’s “Munch (Feelin’ U)” was released last month with an accompanying music video and quickly picked up steam on TikTok. Even Drake got a hold of the record and played it along with several other Ice Spice tracks during an episode of his radio show, and even started following the 22-year-old on Instagram.</p><p>Fans on social media began talking after some discovered <a href=# rel=noopener>Drizzy no longer followed Spice</a>, claiming he was a “savage” for flying her out and showing her some Canadian hospitality.</p><p>Despite the unfollow, Ice Spice has seen her stock grow tremendously to the point that even <a class=underline-link href=#>Joe Budden is singing her catchy song</a> during an episode of his podcast.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/09/drake-steph-curry.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Drake Channels Steph Curry By Sinking 12 Three-Pointers In Rowdy Rebel Basketball Game</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>September 21, 2022</p></a><p>Footage of Budden’s impromptu karaoke session surfaced online earlier this week, and it was nothing short of comical for fans who felt the former rapper added a little too much spice to his performance.</p><p>“‘Oh, you thought I was feeling you? That n-gga’s a munch. N-gga a eater, he ate it for lunch,” Joe Budden said with a huge smile slapped across his face as his co-hosts laughed at him.&nbsp;“You said that a little too spicy, my n-gga,” one of them said.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The “Pump It Up” rapper stood by his Ice Spice fandom and said: “I like that song, and I like her. That song is better than alright. ‘Oh, you thought I was feeling you?'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnaIN5fI6toK2klWO6trrCoWSrmaClsrN5yJycZqugnrCmecOrmKSd</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./paul-teutul-sr-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul Teutul Sr Net Worth">&larr;
