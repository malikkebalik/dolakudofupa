Their on-and-off relationship became a focal point of the show, with the teenage drama playing out onscreen. Despite their eventual breakup, Kristin and Stephen reconnected after her split from Jay Cutler in 2020. While they didn’t rekindle their romance, they collaborated on the “Back to the Beach” podcast, where Kristin issued a decade-late apology for past mistakes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Fling_with_Talan_Torriero></span><strong>A Fling with Talan Torriero</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During her Laguna Beach days, Kristin had a brief fling with co-star Talan Torriero.

She dated Brody Jenner, a fellow reality TV personality from a family well-versed in the genre. Despite their eventual split, Kristin expressed positive sentiments toward Brody and his then-fiancée in a 2016 interview.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Lachey_and_Nick_Zano></span><strong>Nick Lachey and Nick Zano</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2006, Kristin was briefly linked to 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, marking a short-lived romance. Another short-lived relationship followed in the same year with actor Nick Zano, who even had his initials tattooed on Kristin’s wrist. However, the romance did not stand the test of time, leading to the removal of the tattoo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Hills_Love_Triangle></span><strong>The Hills Love Triangle</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A significant storyline on The Hills involved Kristin’s love triangle with Justin Bobby Brescia and Audrina Partridge in 2009.
