Haaland had the best season one could have at club level. He broke a 30-year-old record most said could never be broken, he won the treble and Europe's greatest prize as the focal point in a historic City squad. Finally, he posted nearly one goal per game.</strong></p><p><strong>"Messi is an unbelievable footballer and the World Cup is the cherry on top of an already brilliant career, but I believe we should make way for this new crop of stars and give Haaland the award he undoubtedly deserves."</strong></p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">An individual award that needs team success</h2><p>While many players seemed to struggle to avoid caveats on their past successes, Ilkay Gundogan was clearly loving a little look back on his wonderful 2022-23 season - which included winning the treble with Manchester City and making the Ballon d'Or shortlist for the first time. Here's what he told TNT Sports:</p><p><strong>üí¨ "I'm a very happy man. The last few months were great for me personally and for my family. Finishing the chapter at Manchester City with all the amazing memories, and now fulfilling a childhood dream to join Barca and hopefully also having a special year.</strong></p><p><strong>"This (award) also shows how successful you are as a team. The only way to be a nominee is when you're successful as a club. That's why football is a team sport and I'm proud Man City is represented with a lot of people today, and obviously a few people from Barca. Hopefully next year we can bring even more Barca players."</strong></p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">State of play</h2><span><span></span><img alt="State of play" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Getty Images)</p><p>Just to bring you up to speed, it looks like everyone of significance has now arrived at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, where the Eiffel Tower is sparkling in the distance and firing a beam of light in all directions across the French capital.</p><p>We are due to see the ceremony start at 8pm GMT, which is 4pm Eastern, and there are several awards to be presented.</p><p>Of course, those include the Ballon d'Or Feminin and Ballon d'Or.</p><p>And yes, my highlight so far is Vinicius Junior's stunning suit.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Grand Slams meet Ballon d'Or</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Grand Slams meet Ballon d'Or" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Getty Images)</p><p>Tennis world No 1 Novak Djokovic was just interviewed on the Ballon d'Or red carpet.

He deserves it after leading Argentina to the World Cup, and after performing well in such rough conditions in Paris. As for the importance of the award, I think it‚Äôs more important for the fans than the players. The players should know their worth.

Here's what he said via TNT Sports:</p><p><strong>üí¨ "Life is perfect. I'm enjoying it, enjoying family and doing what I want... I have kids and they play; I watch football when I can. I can do other things too. At the moment I don't miss playing and that's good.
