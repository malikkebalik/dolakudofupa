She has already appeared at many events, and her name appears periodically in major magazines.</p><p class=dh>When she turned six in 2020, her parents threw her a cowgirl-themed birthday party in the Cayman Islands. At her party, the birthday girl who dressed up in a floral romper and matching colored boots had guests like Raul Lopez, the fashion influencer, founder, and creative director of Luar.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HARPER GRACE HAMMER NAME IS A NOD TO THE STREET</strong></p><p class=dh>Harper Grace was born on December 1, 2014, by the late Dr. Jay Goldberg. He was a famous obstetrician and gynecologist known for his appearance on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."</p><p class=dh>Her parents <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/armie-hammer-welcomes-daughter-harper/>chose</a> her name Harper because it reminded them of the street her mother lived in when she met Harper's father. The couple was delighted to have an addition to their family as Harper's arrival made them first-time parents.</p><p class=dh>Harper grew up to be a curious child, and her father said he was learning a lot from her. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/p/cars-3-star-armie-hammer-says-his-daughter-changed-his-view-of-the-world-himself-64561>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm relearning constantly with my daughter because she is like a fresh set of eyes seeing everything in the universe for the first time. So when she goes, 'What's that?' I go, 'Oh, that's a flower' she goes, 'Why?' and I go, 'Well, let's figure it out.'"</p><p class=dh>Harper also made her father change the way he navigated life. Even though he knows the world is getting crazier, he is dedicated to protecting his daughter and raising her to be a strong woman like her mother while being an educated citizen.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HARPER GRACE'S PARENTS ARE NOT HIDING HER FROM THE PUBLIC</strong></p><p class=dh>Relatives regularly share pictures of Harper on social media, and she has also appeared at many events with her parents. That doesn't often happen with celebrity children as their parents try to keep them from the spotlight.</p><p class=dh>However, after her parents filed for divorce, her father <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/armie-hammer-vows-to-stop-posting-pics-of-kids-amid-divorce/>promised</a> not to post photos of his kids for their safety.

While Harper's mother wanted sole physical custody of their children, her father asked for joint legal and physical custody. After the filing, her father <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/10/armie-hammer-wife-elizabeth-chambers-divorce-split/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority."</p><p class=dh>However, they continue to communicate, spend time together, and spend time with the children. During the quarantine, they spent the period together at Cayman Island, where Harper's father grew up.</p><p class=dh>In July 2022, when Harper's mother was asked to comment on her father's Hollywood career after his legal issues, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11028589/Elizabeth-Chambers-daughter-Harper-indulge-nails-day-West-Hollywood.html>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm probably the wrong person to ask that. All that matters is family and our kids."</p><p class=dh>Harper is not the only child of her parents as she has a younger brother, Ford Douglas Armand, born on January 15, 2017.
