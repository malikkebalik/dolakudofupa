The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eras Tour</a>, featuring&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, began in Glendale, Arizona on March 17, 2023 and has continued with two or three shows nearly every week since! The tour’s first leg ended with four shows in Mexico City, Mexico on the last weekend of August 2023. Next up, Taylor will be continue with Latin America dates in November. In June 2023, she announced these tour dates, and by the end of the month, she confirmed more international shows in 2024.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But then, the dates just kept on coming! Days before wrapping up her USA portion of the tour in early August, Taylor announced she would be BACK stateside at the end of 2024, this time getting Canada into the mix as well! “Turns out it’s NOT the end of an era,” she teased on Instagram. “Miami, New Orleans, Indy and Toronto: The Eras Tour is coming to you in 2024 with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gracie Abrams</a></strong>!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Taylor spent months putting together this show for her fans. It is the singer’s<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> first time touring</a> since 2018, and expectations going into the tour were high. Since Taylor’s last tour, she’s released four new albums, as well as two re-recorded versions of old albums (with a third coming on July 7). Speculation about which tracks would actually make the show’s setlist had been rampant amongst fans since Taylor announced the tour in November 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>On opening night, Taylor proved that she would be taking the crowd throughout her entire catalog of music on this tour. She started out with the Lover era, and continued on from there, playing 44 songs in total throughout the evening. As the weeks and number of shows went on, fans found out that there would also be two songs that changed in the setlist each night. Taylor confirmed that these tracks would be different each night of the tour, unless she messed one of them up and had to perform it again at a later date. Find out everything we know about the setlist and tour below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-era-tour-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>Taylor Swift Eras Tour Setlist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Taylor did her best to keep everything about this show under wraps until night one, but fans outside the stadium have got to hear SOME of the songs that she she would be playing beforehand. However, nothing prepared anyone for what Taylor brought out on night one. In addition to playings songs from throughout her career, Taylor also changes into a number of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>different outfits</a> that represent each era throughout the show. Full setlist below:</p><ul><li>“Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince”</li><li>“Cruel Summer”</li><li>“The Man”</li><li>“You Need To Calm Down”</li><li>“Lover”</li><li>“The Archer”</li><li>“Fearless”</li><li>“You Belong With Me”</li><li>“Love Story”</li><li>“Tis The Damn Season”**</li><li>“Willow”</li><li>“Marjorie”</li><li>“Champagne Problems”</li><li>“Tolerate It”</li><li>“…Ready For It?”</li><li>“Delicate”</li><li>“Don’t Blame Me”</li><li>“Look What You Made Me Do”</li><li>“Enchanted”</li><li>“Long Live (Taylor’s Version)* (added after Kansas City, Night 1 on 7/7/23)&nbsp;</li><li>“22”</li><li>“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”</li><li>“I Knew You Were Trouble”</li><li>“All Too Well (10 Minute Version)”</li><li>“Invisible String” // “The 1” ***</li><li>“Betty”</li><li>“The Last Great American Dynasty”</li><li>“August”</li><li>“Illicit Affairs”</li><li>“My Tears Ricochet”</li><li>“Cardigan”</li><li>“Style”</li><li>“Blank Space”</li><li>“Shake It Off”</li><li>“Wildest Dreams”</li><li>“Bad Blood”</li><li>*secret song on acoustic guitar // changes each night**</li><li>*secret song at piano // changes each night**</li><li>“Lavender Haze”</li><li>“Anti-Hero”</li><li>“Midnight Rain”</li><li>“Vigilante S***”</li><li>“Bejeweled”</li><li>“Mastermind”</li><li>“Karma”</li></ul><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although the show was specifically curated, there were some setlist changes even beyond the two secret songs throughout each show. ***During the third weekend of the tour on March 31, Taylor took “Invisible String” off the setlist from the Folklore era. She replaced the song with “The 1” from the same album.***</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Let one thing be said about the Eras Tour, You think you can just go online, you think you can just scroll and know the setlist?” Taylor told the crowd.” You think you can come prepared with your little flashcards in your pockets? ‘I know what’s next. I know what she wears next. I know what she sings next.’ Let it be said about the Eras tour — we’re tricksy! That’s what we are. We enjoy a good, healthy setlist hijinks.” **For the final three weekends of U.S. shows, Taylor took “Tis The Damn Season” off the setlist and replaced it with “No Body, No Crime (feat. HAIM),” who was the opening act for the tour during that run and joined her onstage to perform it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The 33-year-old had hundreds of songs and ten albums to choose from when it came to curating this setlist. Since her last tour, she released the albums Lover, Folklore, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Evermore</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Midnights</a>, as well as re-records of Fearless and Red. The re-records feature several new songs themselves, with additional tracks added that didn’t make the album cuts the first time around. One of those songs is the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fan-favorite</a> “All Too Well (10 Minute Version),” which <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>won a Grammy award</a> and various other accolades, and made it on to the setlist in its entirety.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ll be feeling All Too Well after this performance! ❤️🧣🍂<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@taylornation13</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@taylorswift13</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#GlendaleTSTheErasTour</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/q71wfA5u2C</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>— Dill △⃒⃘ (Taylor’s Version) (@HazelPrince97) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 18, 2023</a></p><h2>Eras Tour Secret Songs</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Towards the end of the Eras Tour setlist, Taylor left two spots open for “secret songs”, which will change every night. One song is played on the acoustic guitar, while the other is played on piano. This is something that Taylor adopted during her Reputation tour in order to play more songs from her catalog that didn’t make it on the setlist.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>During the first show of the Eras Tour, Taylor said that she was going to try and change up the secret songs at every show. With 42 other songs on the original setlist, she still had dozens of tracks to choose from when it came to the secret songs, so there was no shortage of options.

Of course, demand for the tickets was extremely high, so she doubled the amount of shows.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>From the very beginning, fans knew that there would be more to come, too. In Taylor’s announcement post on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, she made it clear that this was just the tour’s first leg. Plus, back in October 2022, the UK Store on Taylor’s website confirmed that dates in England were coming. Fans who preordered Taylor’s album Midnights in the store were given a “special presale code access for forthcoming and yet-to-be-announced UK show dates.” Subsequent legs of the tour have not been confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>For the first leg of the tour, Taylor enlisted various opening acts.

Before the on-sale date, fans were able to sign up for a “verified fan” code, which was Ticketmaster’s attempt at eliminating bots from purchasing tickets. A lottery-style drawing was done, giving only a select number of fans pre-sale codes to purchase tickets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Despite hundreds of thousands of fans not receiving codes and being put on a “waitlist,” Ticketmaster still crashed when hoards of Swifties flocked to the site on the Nov. 15 pre-sale date. Millions of people attempted to log into the sale at the same time, causing the site to crash. The chairman of Live Nation later revealed that 14 million fans were attempting to sign on at once, despite Ticketmaster only expecting 1.5 million based on the codes that had been given out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>Ticketmaster was forced to cancel the regular on-sale for the concert, due to lack of tickets remaining. Thousands of fans were not able to get tickets to the tour, leading to outrage and backlash against Ticketmaster. On Nov. 18, Taylor took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>address the situation</a>. She specifically called out Ticketmaster for not being able to handle the demand of the situation, despite assuring her that it would be covered.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>“It goes without saying that I’m extremely protective of my fans,” Taylor wrote. “We’ve been doing this for decades together and over the years, I’ve brought so many elements of my career in house. I’ve done this SPECIFICALLY to improve the quality of my fans’ experience by doing it myself with my team who care as much about my fans as I do. It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties, and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse. There are a multitude of reasons why people had such a hard time trying to get tickets and I’m trying to figure out how this situation can be improved moving forward. I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could. It’s truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them. And to those who didn’t get tickets, all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us all to get together and sing these songs. Thank you for wanting to be there. You have no idea how much that means.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-31>That same day, Ticketmaster apologized for the fiasco in a statement on its website. The company apologized specifically to Taylor and her fans, while also attempting to explain how things got so out of control. Ticketmaster included statistics to show just how many people were coming to the site to purchase tickets, and explained how this astronomical number was different than what they’ve experienced in the past. “Historically, around 40% of [verified] fans [with presale codes] actually show up and most purchase an average of 3 tickets,” the post explained. “Around 1.5 million [of 3.5 million who signed up] people were sent codes to join the on-sale for all 52 dates.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>The post continued, “This time, the staggering number of bot attacks, as well as fans who didn’t have codes, drove unprecedented traffic on our site, resulting in 3.5 BILLION total system requests.” The company also assured fans that they were “always working to improve the ticket buying experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>In Jan. 2023, Ticketmaster/Live Nation faced a Senate hearing about whether or not its monopoly on the ticket-buying industry is what led to this controversy. During the hearing, the CEO of Live Nation once again apologized to Taylor and her fans. “We need to do better and will do better,” he insisted, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Associated Press</a>. The Ticketmaster higher-ups were grilled by the Senate during the hearing, and many Senators even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pulled out Taylor Swift song lyrics</a> to make their points. It remains to be seen whether or not this hearing will have any effect on the company in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OasKWnomLAuLXFrWSeqpGoerW71KtkrJ2koba0wIxuZ25oaW1%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trey-hendrickson-injury-update-bengals-star-de-expected-to-play-against-bills.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trey Hendrickson Injury Update: Bengals Star DE Expected to Play Against Bills">&larr;
