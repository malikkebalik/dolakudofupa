She filed a lawsuit after reading almost identical allegations from model Minerva Portillo. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>South African-born Bernstein, 53, claims the incident happened at Richardson’s studio in New York in what his assistant said was a shoot for V magazine.</p><p>Bernstein was told that the pictures were for a fragrance called “Sex” and that Richardson, 58, wanted to take “sexy” photos of her.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The high-profile photographer was a regular in Hollywood circles — including the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars party — until allegations of sexual misconduct in 2017 prompted major publishers and advertisers to drop him. <span class=credit>Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><p>V magazine has denied that it asked Richardson to do such a shoot, the lawsuit says.</p><p>The suit says: “Instead of engaging in a professional photoshoot with Bernstein, Richardson instead sexually assaulted Bernstein, without her express or implied consent, by holding Bernstein’s head and forcing Richardson’s erect penis into and out of Bernstein’s mouth repeatedly and then ejaculating Richardson’s semen on Bernstein’s neck, chest, and breasts.”</p><p>The lawsuit describes the attack as “oral sodomy” and claims that between five and eight of Richardson’s employees or assistants were present</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bernstein, who was part of the New York social scene as a model, alleges that Richardson exploited the attack in his art book and exhibition. <span class=credit>Rich Press</span></figure><p>Richardson “further abused and humiliated” Bernstein by taking photos of the assault as it happened.</p><p>These images appeared in his art book Kibosh and his exhibition “Terryworld” says the suit, which is seeking damages for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress as well as gender-motivated violence.</p><p>Richardson was one of the world’s most famed fashion photographers, shooting Pres. Obama, Miley Cyrus and a host of celebrities, until 2017 when he was accused of sexual assault and rape by numerous women during the MeToo movement.</p><p>That included Richardson who made similar allegations to her lawsuit in media interviews.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Minerva Portillo, a Spanish model with a career going back more than 20 years, accused Terry Richardson of forcing her into oral sex in a suit filed on the last possible day. She inspired Bernstein to act, the second model’s attorneys said. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Her claims led to fashion designer Tom Ford – who Bernstein modeled for – defending Richardson, saying “I love Terry” and that he had never seen such behavior around him.</p><p>Bernstein responded at the time by saying that Ford’s comments were a “f—ing abuse of power.”</p><p>Bernstein began modeling at 14 and her acting credits include 2007’s “Resident Evil: Extinction.”</p><p>Her lawyer Albert Santoro said that she had seen the Post’s report about Portillo and was “humbled and inspired by her courage and bravery.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The photographer’s links to Vogue made him a regular at its parties, including a 95th anniversary celebration where he posed with Kanye West and Jared Leto. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Vogue</span></figure><p>She “spent Thanksgiving with her attorneys” deciding whether to file her own lawsuit and decided to do so in order to stand “shoulder to shoulder with the other victims.”</p><p>The Post has contacted Richardson and his studio for comment.</p><p>He previously called allegations against him an “emotionally charged witch hunt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma2xfo7K4v46tnKuqqWK%2Fqq%2FHmqmdq5%2BjerSxwqilnWWdpLGmuIyco5qhnah6qbGMq5ipnZRitaa%2BjJ%2Bmq2WRp8Fw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dereke-alexander-murder-what-happened-to-jerry-alford-and-dexter-moore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dereke Alexander Murder: What Happened to Jerry Alford and Dexter Moore?">&larr;
