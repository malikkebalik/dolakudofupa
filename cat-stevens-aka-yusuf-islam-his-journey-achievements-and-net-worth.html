His remarkable journey, conversion to Islam, and enduring legacy have made him an iconic figure in the world of music.

His early exposure to music and his natural talent for it set the stage for a lifelong passion.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2-48.png alt="Cat Stevens" width=1422 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Cat Stevens’ musical journey began as he taught himself to play chords on the family piano and, influenced by the Beatles’ success, he ventured into learning the guitar.</p><p>He started writing his own songs and drew inspiration from the musical performances he watched in the Soho theatre district, which was close to his home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rise_of_Cat_Stevens></span><strong>Rise of Cat Stevens</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cat Stevens adopted his stage name and began his solo career. At the young age of 18, he recorded his first hit single, “Matthew and Son,” which catapulted him to fame. He followed this success with another single, “I’m Gonna Get Me a Gun,” and his debut album, “Matthew and Son.”</p><p>The early 70s marked the peak of his career, with the release of his internationally acclaimed album, “Tea for the Tillerman,” in 1970. This album featured iconic tracks such as “Father and Son” and “Wild World.” His records sold millions of copies worldwide, and his popularity soared. Cat Stevens reached a global audience, earning a dedicated fanbase.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cat_Stevens_Awards></span><strong>Cat Stevens Awards </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Throughout his career, Cat Stevens received numerous accolades, including multiple Grammy nominations and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. His enduring contributions to music have made him a celebrated figure in the industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conversion_to_Islam></span><strong>Conversion to Islam</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1977, Cat Stevens underwent a significant transformation in his life. He converted to Islam and embraced the name Yusuf Islam. His introduction to Islam occurred during a visit to Morocco, where he heard the call to prayer. This spiritual awakening deepened after a near-death experience when he was saved from drowning by a powerful wave. He turned to God and began an in-depth study of Islam, which eventually led to his conversion.</p><p>His decision to embrace Islam also marked a turning point in his music career. Certain individuals within the religion suggested that a career as a pop musician was inconsistent with Islamic values. As a result, Yusuf Islam abandoned his musical career, an act that left the world wondering about the future of this iconic artist.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-95.png alt="Cat Stevens" width=904 height=888 data-sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Return_of_Yusuf_Islam></span><strong>The Return of Yusuf Islam</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After a long hiatus from music, Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, made a return to the industry during the 2000s. He began creating music that integrated his faith and experiences. While his early post-conversion music focused on Muslim themes and featured only percussion instruments, he gradually reintroduced the guitar and other instruments into his compositions.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>Andre Rieu Net Worth</a></p><p>He embarked on extensive tours, reintroducing himself to fans worldwide and promoting his new music. In 2017, he released his fifteenth studio album, “The Laughing Apple,” showcasing his musical evolution.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cat_Stevens_Net_Worth></span><strong>Cat Stevens Net Worth </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cat Stevens net worth is $10 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_and_Philanthropy></span><strong>Income and Philanthropy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite his extended hiatus from the music industry, Yusuf Islam’s royalties alone have earned him over $1.5 million annually. He made headlines when he expressed his intention to utilize the majority of his wealth for philanthropic purposes in the future, reflecting his deep commitment to his faith’s principles of charity and goodwill.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversies_and_Backtracking></span><strong>Controversies and Backtracking</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yusuf Islam was involved in a significant controversy during the late 1980s. He expressed agreement with the view that Salman Rushdie, the author of “The Satanic Verses,” should be killed due to the alleged blasphemous content in his book. His exact words were: “He must die. The Qur’an makes it clear – if someone defames the prophet, then he must die.” Later, he claimed it was a joke and ultimately denied having made such comments.</p><p>In 2004, Yusuf Islam was denied entry into the United States amid allegations of connections to terrorist-related activities, particularly his alleged funding of Hamas. He has consistently denied doing so knowingly and was placed on a watch list by the Department of Homeland Security. He was eventually admitted into the United States without further incident.</p><p>Yusuf Islam’s life journey, marked by spiritual transformation, musical evolution, and controversies, serves as a testament to the power of faith and the enduring impact of his music on the world. As of 2022, he enjoys a net worth of $10 million, earned both through his earlier musical career and his enduring legacy.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57wpqrZqukmsOmutJmmKSZXa7CtMHFZqCspJGieqm10mahqK2io7K6ecCcn6Kdppq6prrTrGSappRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./irish-daily-mail-mailword-small-spanish-gentleman-crossword-clue-spanish-gentleman-answer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Irish Daily Mail Mailword Small Spanish gentleman Crossword Clue, Spanish gentleman Answer">&larr;
