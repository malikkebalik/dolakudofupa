He founded Orange County Choppers and Orange County Iron Works and starred in several reality series, including “American Chopper,” “American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior,” “Orange County Choppers,” and “Orange County Choppers: American Made.”</p><p>Paul also produced many episodes of “American Chopper,” and his sons, Paul Jr. and Mikey, have appeared with him on the show. He has written two books, “Orange County Choppers: The Tale of the Teutuls” and “Ride of a Lifetime: Doing Business the Orange County Choppers Way,” and has made appearances in films, TV shows, and music videos.</p><p>Paul competed on “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2012 and 2013, finishing in eighth place. In 2007, he and his son won an Astra Award for “American Chopper.”</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Military_Service>Early Life and Military Service</span></h2><p>Paul Teutul Sr. was born on May 1, 1949 in Yonkers, New York and grew up in Pearl River, New York.</p><p>At age 18, Paul joined the United States Merchant Marines during the Vietnam War.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Sr_From_Pauls_Welding_to_OCC_Road_House_and_Museum>Paul Teutul Sr: From Paul’s Welding to OCC Road House and Museum</span></h2><p>Paul Teutul Sr’s love for motorcycles began in the 1970s after watching films like “Easy Rider” and “Hells Angels on Wheels.” He started his fabrication work by launching Paul’s Welding with one pick-up truck and a welding machine. Later, he expanded the business to a 7,000 square foot Rock Tavern facility and renamed it Orange County Iron which was later changed to Orange County Ironworks, LLC. He eventually opened Orange County Choppers in Newburgh, New York, and handed the reigns of Orange County Ironworks over to his son Dan.</p><p>“American Choppers” premiered on the Discovery Channel in 2003 and has aired over 230 episodes, including spin-offs such as “American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior,” “Orange County Choppers,” and “Orange County Choppers: American Made.” In 2020, Teutul decided to close the Newburgh Orange County Choppers location and opened OCC Road House and Museum in Pinellas Park, Florida, in June 2021. The 11,000 square foot facility includes a billiards hall, floor games, a vast collection of carefully selected motorcycles and memorabilia, a live event space, retail space, bar, and restaurant.</p><p>Orange County Choppers has built bikes for charities like the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Iraq Star, and in 2010, the company established the non-profit organization The OCC Foundation, Inc. Paul stated, “Through the OCC Foundation, we hope to take our charitable efforts to a whole new level, and of course, we’ll continue to need the support of our friends and fans to make this happen.”</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Srs_Personal_Life_and_Legal_Troubles>Paul Teutul Sr.’s Personal Life and Legal Troubles</span></h2><p>Paul Teutul Sr. was married to Paula Teutul from 1969 to 1995. The couple had four children including Paul Jr., Michael, Daniel, and Cristin. Paul Sr. and Paul Jr. frequently argued on “American Chopper,” a reality TV show that followed their motorcycle-building business. Additionally, Paul Jr. was fired from Orange County Choppers in 2009 but later returned as a consultant. Mikey left the family’s TV ventures in 2012 but returned when “American Chopper” was revived in 2018. Dan runs Orange County Ironworks, and Cristin is a pediatric nurse.</p><p>Paul married Beth Dillon in 2007 and they divorced in 2015 after a three-year separation. He has been in a relationship with Joan Bulger-Kay since 2011. Paul has multiple tattoos, including one reading “OCC New York,” which he got because he was frustrated with people thinking Orange County Choppers was located in Orange County, California. In 2015, Paul was featured on the show “Tattoo Titans.”</p><p>In April 2017, Paul was sued by his business partner, Thomas Derbyshire, who alleged that Paul used a portion of the money Derbyshire had invested in “Orange County Choppers: American Made” for his personal use. Derbyshire accused Paul of holding up production and making deals without consulting him as well. Additionally, Paul was sued by JTM Motorsports, who claimed that he had made a deal that he’d promote the business if JTM would work on his Corvette for free. In a 2018 statement of financial affairs, Paul stated that he was involved in eight lawsuits at the time.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Sr_Files_for_Bankruptcy>Paul Teutul Sr. Files for Bankruptcy</span></h2><p>In March 2018, Paul Teutul Sr. filed for bankruptcy, listing debts of $1,070,893 and assets of $1,801,729.

Despite the filing, Teutul’s attorney called it “proactive, not reactive,” which is seen as a positive thing for his client.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Sr_sells_New_York_mansion_for_19_million>Paul Teutul Sr sells New York mansion for $1.9 million</span></h2><p>Former reality TV star and motorcycle designer, Paul Teutul Sr, sold his 3,448 square foot New York mansion for $1.9 million in mid-2019.
