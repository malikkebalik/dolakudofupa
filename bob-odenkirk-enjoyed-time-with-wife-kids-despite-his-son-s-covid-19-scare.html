The couple has created a cozy family for themselves and loves spending time together.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Recently, Odenkirk made headlines when&nbsp;his son, Nathan,&nbsp;contracted&nbsp;COVID-19. The actor talked about his son's struggles in many of his interviews and sounded grateful for his recovery.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Decades Down, Forever To Go</h2><p>The Better Call Saul&nbsp;actor has been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">happily married</a> to his producer wife Naomi Yomtov for almost 24 years now. In her interview, the actress admitted to having a crush on Bob since the day she saw him performing comedy&nbsp;at the Uncaberet&nbsp;in 1994, in&nbsp;West Hollywood, California. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Naomi also admitted to having a gut feeling that she would get married to Bob one day and expressed it to her then-roommate.&nbsp;</p><p>Her gut feeling came true after all, as the two went on to get married in 1997 and share&nbsp;son, Nathan, and daughter, Erin. They are often spotted&nbsp;together in numerous red carpet events.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Bob Odenkirk and Wife Naomi YomTov in the 2017 Golden Globe Awards </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pinterest</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span>He Almost Turned Down The Saul Goodman Role</span></h2><p><span>Being the family man that&nbsp;he is, Odenkirk, in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Vulture</a>, confessed that he had decided to silently turn down the offered role of Saul Goodman in&nbsp;&nbsp;Better Call Saul. The actor</span>&nbsp;asked his manager to turn the role&nbsp;down as it&nbsp;meant he&nbsp;had to spend four and a half months&nbsp;away from his family.</p><p>The actor didn't think it was fair to his wife and his teenage kids and did not want to even ask them about it. However, after finding out about the role, his kids urged him&nbsp;to take the job. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bob Talks About His Son’s Battle With COVID-19</h2><p>The SNL veteran expressed his son’s health and their struggle while battling Corona in one of the episodes of The Late Late Show With James Corden&nbsp;on April 17, 2020. While on the show, the actor talked openly about his fears and concerns regarding his son’s health and how it felt&nbsp;to be under the same roof with his children after a long time.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The comic went on to add that his son went through a lot of pain, and his asthma only added to the problem. He also shared that he and his family&nbsp;were up on their toes and had a dreadful experience during the first weeks of Nathan contracting the virus.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Later on in the interview, the comic expressed that he considers himself extremely lucky because his son recovered within a few weeks. Bob added that although it was hard for Nathan, it was a relief that he got out of it pretty easy, compared to other people. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Happiest To Be Under The Same Roof</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the same show, when asked how he felt about living with his wife and children&nbsp;in the same house,&nbsp;the comic confessed with a big smile&nbsp;that he absolutely loved it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Odenkirk<span> happily explained that they didn't get much time to be together with his kids. But the quarantine had provided them with an amazing opportunity to be together under the same roof after quite some time.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The comic also added that he considered himself and his family lucky to have a big enough home to shelter all four of them. And went to thank everyone doing their part to&nbsp;help fight this virus by staying indoors.</p><h2>Collapsed During Shooting</h2><p>On 28 July 2021, Odenkirk was <a href=# rel=follow>rushed to the hospital</a> after collapsing on the sets of&nbsp;Better Call Saul. He was taken to a&nbsp;hospital in Albuquerque via ambulance.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The following day,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNN&nbsp;reported</a>&nbsp;Odenkirk was&nbsp;in stable condition. The reports mention he collapsed due to a "heart-related incident."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Odenkirk's son, Nate, was prompt to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet&nbsp;an update</a>&nbsp;on his father's condition as well. The tweet iterated that Odenkirk was going to be okay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8o3nOnZyno5mnuG7DyJ%2BcZqOZmcBvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaitlyn-maher-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaitlyn Maher  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
