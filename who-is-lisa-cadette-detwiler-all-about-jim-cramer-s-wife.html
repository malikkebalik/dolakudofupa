Jim is an American television personality best known as the host of CNBC’s show Mad Money. According to Jim, he started small and there was a time he worked as an ice cream vendor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I sold ice cream at the Vet for four years!! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/8aG5Lj01v5</a></p><p>— Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 2, 2018</a></p><p>At that point in their love lives, both Lisa and Jim were coming out of their previous marriages and were not really active on the dating scene.
