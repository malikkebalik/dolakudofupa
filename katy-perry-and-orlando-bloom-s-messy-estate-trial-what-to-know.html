It was later renovated by Lutah Maria Riggs, the first woman named a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.&nbsp;</p><p>According to court documents obtained by The Post, Westcott claims that the July 14, 2020 contract for the sale of his home was done when he “lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature and probable consequences of the contract.”</p><p>The Post has reached out to reps for Westcott, Bloom and Perry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Here’s everything you need to know about this messy court battle, the estate in question and a timeline of the tumultuous back and forth between the Hollywood couple and Westcott, the founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1-800-Flowers</a>.</strong></h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The 9,285-square-foot home, which sits on roughly 2.5 acres, features scenic views including a patio that overlooks the entire property and the Pacific Ocean. <span class=credit>Village Properties</span></figure><p>The 8.9 acre estate, located at 1569 E. Valley Road boasts a Mediterranean-style, four-bedroom main house, a detached four-car garage underneath a guesthouse and a pool house.</p><p>“The main house still retains much of its original aesthetics, like a white stucco exterior and a red-tiled roof framed by tall, swaying palm trees,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Architectural Digest</a>. “A rotunda entryway gives way to a picturesque living room featuring a whole wall of French doors that open out onto a shaded brick dining terrace. Sandy-colored hardwood floors and a wood-beamed ceiling give the space a warm feel.”</p><p>The 9,285-square-foot home, which sits on roughly 2.5 acres, features scenic views including a patio that overlooks the entire property and the Pacific Ocean.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have been accused in court docs of buying a $14.2 million Montecito home without proper consent. <span class=credit>Village Properties</span></figure><p>“The kitchen boasts a unique green patterned wallpaper that covers not only all four walls, but the ceiling as well,” Architectural Digest explains of the property’s unique interior. “The cabinets, painted a rustic sea green, add a fun edge to the room, which opens onto a breakfast nook and a separate butler’s pantry. The main suite occupies more than half of the upper level, boasting a whole host of amenities, including a stately wood-burning fireplace, two bathrooms, a large custom-fitted dressing room and a separate walk-in closet. The subterranean level houses a wood-paneled private office and a conference room. Outdoors, the estate continues to dazzle, with a full-size tennis court, grassy lawns, plenty of formal gardens and multiple fountains dotting the property.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2015</h2><p>Westcott is diagnosed with a genetic brain disorder known as&nbsp;Huntington’s disease.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>May 2020</h2><p>Westcott, who served in the US Army as a 101st Airborne service member, purchases the home for $11.25 million as his permanent residence on May 29 with the intent to live there “for the rest of his life,” court documents state.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The kitchen features a high wood-beamed ceiling which gives the space a warm feel. <span class=credit>Village Properties</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>July 2020</h2><p>Perry and Orlando purchase the home from Westcott for $14.2 million, but Westcott allegedly immediately regrets the sale. Discharged from the hospital after undergoing a major six-hour back surgery on July 11, 2020 the war veteran’s legal counsel claim, in court documents obtained by The Post, that a July 14 contract for the sale of his home was done when he “lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature and probable consequences of the contract.”</p><p>The complaint argues that “upon discharge from the hospital, Mr. Westcott was prescribed at least two opiates in pill form that he was to continue taking for pain, which he took as prescribed several times each day. The combination of his age, frailty from his back condition and recent surgery, and the opiates he was taking several times a day rendered Mr. Westcott of unsound mind and not competent to give his free, voluntary, or intelligent consent to the contract.”</p><p>On July 22, Westcott claims to “feel mentally clear again,” rid of the opiates from the surgery. He then sent a letter to the real estate agency representing the property.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The long-awaited trial between Carl Westcott (inset) and the Hollywood couple officially commenced on Sept. 27, 2023. <span class=credit>NY Post photo composite</span></figure><p>“Mr. Westcott sent an email to Berkshire Hathaway, in its capacity as the dual agent for seller and buyer,<br>that he did not want to sell his home,” the complaint states. He “gave it his deepest consideration, but that he is in the final few years of his life and he cannot sell his home.”</p><p>In perhaps a last ditch effort to save the deal, Perry and Bloom also pen a letter to Westcott on July 22.</p><p>“We are writing this letter to you to express&nbsp;our appreciation&nbsp;with regard to your agreement to sell your property to us and to communicate our joy at being able to call it our home,” the singer and actor began. “As you know we are expecting a baby next month and know that this will be the best place to bring her home to and raise her in.”</p><p>The couple, who welcomed their daughter Daisy on Aug. 26, continued, “Though there were&nbsp;other properties&nbsp;that did interest us, yours will provide us the comfort of security, privacy, and safety. These three details are of the utmost importance to us and the reason we were willing to pay a premium and move forward on your property specifically. This home will be a respite, one where we will be able to grow together as a family. We have gone through some challenges in the past week, our&nbsp;beloved dog&nbsp;Mighty passed away.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are set to go to trial later this month over their $14.2 million Montecito mansion purchase. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“With such devastating news, being the lucky people to purchase your home is a shining light to help get us through such&nbsp;a difficult time,” they continued. “We hope you can appreciate that you are turning your home over to a very loving couple, who are expecting their first baby and have nothing but joy at the thought of making their life and future memories there.”</p><p>The letter did not sway Westcott in their favor.</p><p>According to court documents, on July 24 Westcott received a letter from Bloom and Perry’s lawyer, Bernie Gudvi.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carl Westcott surrounded by family as he battles Huntington’s disease. “Real Housewives of Dallas”&nbsp;reality star Kameron Westcott is the war vet’s daughter-in-law. <span class=credit>Facebook – Kameron Westcott</span></figure><p>“The letter stated, in sum&nbsp;and substance, that the lawyer represented not only Mr. Gudvi, but also Mr. Orlando Bloom and Ms. Katheryn Hudson (professionally known as Katy Perry) on whose behalf Mr. Gudvi had always been acting.&nbsp;“The letter advised Mr. Westcott that his clients Mr. Bloom and Ms. Hudson are not willing to walk away from purchasing Mr. Westcott’s home and he is obligated to complete the sale.”</p><p>However Westcott’s lawyers argue that the contract to sell his home is “voidable” due to his mental state.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>October 2021</h2><p>Westcott is transferred to a mental health facility in Dallas after a suicide attempt. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to People,</a> “his attorney stated in court that his client feared memory loss from his condition. Westcott is currently living at a facility for patients facing dementia and was not well enough to attend trial.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Westcott claimed that due to his age, poor health from Huntington’s disease, and “a major six-hour surgery less than a week before the proposed contract,” it had “seriously impaired [his] mental faculties to the point he was of unsound mind and not competent to give his free, voluntary, or intelligent consent to the contract.” <span class=credit>Kameron Westcott/Facebook</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>September 2023</h2><p>Perry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans bash the singer</a> on social media for the lawsuit which is viewed as malicious.</p><p>“Why are you trying to kick a dying vet out of his house?”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed</a>&nbsp;one angry fan on X. “What is wrong with you? Your&nbsp;real estate&nbsp;agent is so shady, getting him to sign something while he’s on drugs from surgery in the hospital.”&nbsp;</p><p>“What’s up with Katy Perry & her disturbing real estate deals/scams in CA?”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asked&nbsp;</a>a second fan.</p><p>“WOW who knew @katyperry & Orlando Bloom were such scumbags and terrible people,” sneered a third person. “To think she comes from a very religious family. To do this to a vet and someone who is in the last years of their life.”</p><p>The non-jury trial officially commenced on Sept. 27. Both parties’ legal teams delivered their opening statements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>“Westcott’s attorney Andrew Thomas said that his client had been showing signs of ‘delusion’ and ‘intrusive thoughts’ after taking painkillers hydrocodone, gabapentin and tramadol when he sold his home on July 15,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to People</a>. “Five days before the sale, Westcott had spinal surgery on his back. According to attorney Thomas, the contract was presented to Westcott while he was residing in Dallas and was still recovering from ‘post-operative delirium.’ “</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>October 2023</h2><p>On Oct. 5 an unidentified woman barged twice into the courtroom while Dr. Daniel Franc was testifying on the stand, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to People</a>. The expert neurologist was answering questions about Westcott’s “cognitive capacity” from Perry and Bloom’s business manager Bernie Gudvi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0>According to the People reporter, “the first time, the court clerk asked her to calm down and leave, and Westcott’s attorney Andrew Thomas, who appeared shaken, urged deputies to be called. After the woman stormed into court again, deputies arrived to remove her from the courtroom.”</p><p>The judge later revealed that the woman had no connection to Perry, Bloom, Westcott or the case at hand, however she was upset with the judge over a previous case he presided over.</p><p>This story is still developing.</p><p><strong>If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SuicidePreventionLifeline.org</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmbGhfoK61xYypnKuqqWKur7CMqKmlmZ6ZvG6uy6impqtdorK0v9hmnKyskamybsDRopilZaedrrV506hkpKafrHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tragic-demise-of-bnnvara-actor-and-oogappels-star-shakes-internet-with-viral-video-reiky-de-valk.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tragic Demise of BNNVARA Actor and Oogappels Star Shakes Internet with Viral Video  Reiky De Valk">&larr;
