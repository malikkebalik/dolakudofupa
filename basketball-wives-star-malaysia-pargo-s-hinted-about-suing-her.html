The show documented the women’s awkward situations as they attempted to preserve their work-life balance and repair their connections.</h3><p>The sitcom did, however, succeed in fitting a lot of theatrics into a one-hour episode, which provided for some interesting viewing.</p><p>This week, Malaysia said that she was thinking about taking her ex-husband Jannero Pargo to court over his neglect of their children and failure to provide child support. She explored the idea of leaving the decision to God and seeing where things go from there with her friend Lala while looking for homes in the city.</p><p>In recent episodes of Basketball Wives, Malaysia has been vocal about her ex-husband Jannero’s failure to provide child support and support in raising children. Three of the couple’s children have lived in Malaysia for a while. The actor felt it was time for a bigger house because they were living in a little property in Los Angeles.</p><p>Lala, a friend, joined Malaysia as she toured homes with a real estate agent. Malaysia responded that her ex-husband was not helping with the property when the other person asked if he was.</p><p>She then acknowledged that she was thinking about taking him to court to settle the child support issue, but first, she would pray about it and wait for God’s response. Supporters offered their opinions about the situation on social media.</p><h2>Review of Basketball Wives episode 6</h2><p>On June 20, 2022, Basketball Wives episode 6 was broadcast. It featured significant upheaval in the lives of the cast members as they contended with their relationships, took part in a variety of pleasurable activities, and had multiple conversations that provided insight into how they lived.</p><p>While some people celebrated all that was good in life, others struggled with issues brought on by poor communication and strained relationships.</p><p>Duffey emphasizes the importance of a career, Angel gets her kids ready for the new arrival, Jackie gathers the women for a podcast, and Brandi experiences a health emergency.</p><p>Last week, Jackie Christie spoke with Brandi Maxiell and Nia Dorsey about inviting all the women to her show to talk about Life After Basketball.</p><p>The Basketball Wives actress stated that she would like to talk about what her other cast members go through as partners, spouses, or ex-spouses of well-known basketball players. Despite their disagreements, she claimed they were still a part of the “basketball family.”</p><p>Because of what transpired between Malaysia and her ex-best friend, Brandi grew upset when the host of The Jackie Christie Project revealed that Malaysia would be one of the guests. She claimed, however, that they had some amazing experiences and that she harbored no ill will against Malaysia.</p><p>Brittish Williams confronted Lorenzo about posting pictures of their daughter on social media with his new girlfriend.</p><p>She set strict boundaries with him and was very clear that she was against the idea of a stranger putting pictures of her child online. She then acknowledged that every time she thought about getting back together, his actions would swiftly bring back her reasons for breaking up with him in the first place.</p><p>Meanwhile, Malaysia Pargo opened out about her tumultuous marriage to her ex-husband Jannero Pargo, who switched from player to coach.</p><p>The Basketball Wives star acknowledged that even though their relationship didn’t work out, they still had three children and a lot of wonderful memories. The son of Angel Brinks complained about his mother’s lack of communication and voiced worry that she would grow even more distant once the baby was born.</p><p>The actress contemplated how she raised her son without his father before collapsing (ex-husband Bruce Sandlin). As she promised to spend more time with him, the mother-son bond was revived.</p><p>The series has drawn a lot of attention since it debuted on VH1 in 2010, and it continues to be one of the most-watched reality shows on television. With new women joining the show each season, the Basketball Wives cast has amassed a recognizable name in reality television.</p><p>Among the cast members are Jackie Christie, Malaysia Pargo, Brandi Maxiell, DJ Duffey, Brooke Bailey, Jennifer Williams, and Brittish Williams.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Christina Ferra-Gilmore</a></h3>Christina Ferra-Gilmore estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
