From unanimous votes to shocking twists, the game is full of surprises. So, who has been evicted so far? Let’s dive in and find out!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Big_Brother_Season_25_Evictions></span>Big Brother Season 25 Evictions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img post-id=19632 fifu-featured=1 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matt-blue-kirsten-hisam-bb25-1691068797866-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_1_%E2%80%93_Kirsten_Elwin></span>Week 1 – Kirsten Elwin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kristen-big-brother-1692323768715.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>The first week of Big Brother Season 25 saw the eviction of Kirsten Elwin. Despite her efforts to rally some of the houseguests to vote in her favor, Kirsten found herself on the receiving end of a unanimous vote. With no allies in the game, she became an easy target for the other contestants. It was a tough break for Kirsten, who didn’t even get a chance to experience life in the jury house.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_2_%E2%80%93_Reilly_Smedley></span>Week 2 – Reilly Smedley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reilly-big-brother-1692323963055.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>In Week 2, Reilly Smedley, who had held the Head of Household position, was sent packing. It seemed like a case of karma catching up to her, as she had spent the previous week convincing the houseguests to vote out Kirsten. The other players saw this as an opportunity to strike back and unanimously voted for Reilly’s eviction. It was a reminder that alliances can quickly shift in the game of Big Brother.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_3_%E2%80%93_Hisam_Goueli></span>Week 3 – Hisam Goueli<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hisam-goueli-1692929493361.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Week 3 brought another unanimous eviction in the form of Hisam Goueli. With an 11-0 vote, Hisam was sent home from the Big Brother house. While fans were sad to see him go, Hisam’s reaction to discovering a secret between Cirie and Jared provided some comedic relief. It was a memorable moment in a season filled with unexpected twists and turns.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_4_%E2%80%93_Jag_Bains></span>Week 4 – Jag Bains<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jag-big-brother-1693534168927.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Jag Bains faced a unanimous vote for eviction in Week 4. However, due to the Power of Invincibility being used, Jag was able to stay in the house. This led to a unique situation where the entire house, including the outgoing Head of Household, had to compete in the HoH competition. It was a tense week for all the contestants as they fought to secure their positions in the game.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_5_%E2%80%93_Red_Utley></span>Week 5 – Red Utley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/red-big-brother-1694137568474.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Breaking away from the pattern of unanimous evictions, Red Utley was voted out of the Big Brother house with a vote of 8-2 in Week 5. Red expressed his disappointment during his exit interview, specifically calling out Cam for betraying him. The revelation of alliances and the resulting tension added a new layer of complexity to the game.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_6_%E2%80%93_Izzy_Gleicher></span>Week 6 – Izzy Gleicher<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/izzy-gleicher-1694743369355.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>In Week 6, Izzy Gleicher became the latest houseguest to be evicted, with a vote of 8-1. She left the house feeling betrayed by Cory, whom she had considered a close ally. The game of Big Brother is known for its shifting dynamics and the importance of trust, and Izzy’s eviction served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the competition.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_7_%E2%80%93_Cameron_Hardin_and_Jared_Fields></span>Week 7 – Cameron Hardin and Jared Fields<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cameron-hardin-big-brother-25-houseguest-1697206615751.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Week 7 brought a double eviction, resulting in the eviction of two houseguests. Cameron Hardin was the first to be evicted with a vote of 8-0. The fast-paced nature of double evictions adds an extra layer of excitement to the game, as the remaining contestants must quickly adapt to the changing dynamics. Following Cameron’s eviction, Jared Fields was also voted out by a vote of 6-1. The double eviction week marked a significant turning point in the season.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_8_%E2%80%93_Jared_Fields></span>Week 8 – Jared Fields<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jared-fields-big-brother-25-houseguest-1697206624223.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>After a zombie battleback twist competition, Cameron Hardin fought his way back into the game, leading to Jared Fields’ eviction by default in Week 8. This marked Jared’s second eviction from the Big Brother house. The unexpected twists and turns of the game kept the houseguests on their toes and provided viewers with thrilling moments.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_9_%E2%80%93_Mecole_Hayes></span>Week 9 – Mecole Hayes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jared-fields-big-brother-25-houseguest-1697206629442.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Week 9 saw another unanimous eviction, with Mecole Hayes being voted out by a vote of 7-0.

With a vote of 6-0, Cameron’s journey in the game came to an end. During his exit interview, he took responsibility for his mistakes and jokingly asked if he could re-enter the game. However, his time in the competition had come to a definitive close, as he headed to the jury house.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_11_%E2%80%93_Cory_Wurtenberger></span>Week 11 – Cory Wurtenberger<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cameron-hardin-big-brother-25-houseguest-1697206638908.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>In Week 11, Cory Wurtenberger was evicted from the Big Brother house with a vote of 5-0.
