Cassian’s origin story begins with a common crook who is down on his luck and desperate, rather than with Jedi and Sith or a civil war between the Empire and the Rebellion.</p><p>The opening minutes, which feel like a neo-noir crime thriller straight out of Blade Runner, soon give way to a very grounded story about people you don’t normally see in a Star Wars film, such as the blue collar workers who keep the Empire’s corporate interests running. We meet a whole new cast of characters on planets like Ferrix, Morlana One, and Kenari, the people who shape Cassian’s past and help him become who he needs to be in Rogue One.</p><h2><strong>Cassian Andor is played by Diego Luna</strong></h2><p>Cassian Andor is a member of the Rebel Alliance who was instrumental in obtaining the Death Star plans, a major victory that allowed Luke Skywalker to eventually destroy the terrifying space weapon. Years before that fateful mission, however, he was far less interested in the idea of rebellion, with this series delving into what eventually transformed him into a dedicated freedom fighter.</p><p>Luna began his acting career in Mexico, where he worked alongside childhood friend Gael Garca Bernal (who will soon star in Marvel’s Werewolf by Night). Aside from Star Wars, he is known for his roles in Milk, the sci-fi thriller Elysium, the romantic drama If Beale Street Could Talk, and the animated DC’s League of Super-Pets. In Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico, he portrayed Miguel Angel Félix Gallardo.</p><h2><strong>Luthen Rael is played by Stellan Skarsgard</strong></h2><p>Stellan Skarsgrd, a veteran character actor, plays the cunning Luthen Rael in Andor. On the surface, Luthen appears to be a collector and a black market dealer. His true goal, however, is to sow the seeds of rebellion quietly. His encounter with Cassian Andor will alter both of their lives.</p><p>Fans of geek culture will recognise Skarsgrd from his recurring role as Dr. Erik Selvig in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He’s also well-known for his roles in Dune, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Angels & Demons, Mamma Mia!, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Good Will Hunting, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, and numerous other films.</p><h2>Adria Arjona as Bix Caleen</h2><p>Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona, is a mechanic by day and a black market dealer by night. She also appears to be one of Cassian’s oldest friends on Ferrix, and may have been more than friends in the past. While we don’t know much else about Bix, it’s clear she despises authority, particularly Preox-Morlana goons.</p><p>The Puerto Rican actor was most recently seen as Marvel character Martine Bancroft in this year’s Spider-Man-inspired vampire film Morbius. She also played the titular bride in the 2022 remake of Father of the Bride by Warner Bros. Arjona previously starred in NBC’s Wizard of Oz TV series Emerald City, as Anathema in Good Omens, and as Jules Reyes in Pacific Rim: Uprising.</p><h2><strong>Mon Mothma is played by Genevieve O’Reilly</strong></h2><p>Rebel Alliance figurehead Mon Mothma made her Star Wars debut in Return of the Jedi, played by Caroline Blakiston at the time. Andor will be played by Genevieve O’Reilly, who first played the character in Revenge of the Sith before reprising the role in Rogue One.</p><p>Mothma, like many other Rebellion political leaders, was a Republic senator who was vehemently opposed to the Imperial regime that replaced democracy. She and her colleagues tried everything they could to instil change within the system and solve problems through politics, but the power of the Galactic Empire was simply too great to overcome.</p><p>Mothma was a founding member of the Rebel Alliance, and after their victory in the Galactic Civil War, he succeeded Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor of the New Republic.</p><p>Andor will most likely give us our best look yet at Mothma’s role in advocating for peace and democracy in the Empire, as the reveal trailer already revealed that we’ll be seeing the Imperial Senate for the first time.</p><h2><strong>Maarva Andor is played by Fiona Shaw</strong></h2><p>Fiona Shaw, an Irish actress, has appeared in dozens of films and television shows, most notably in the Harry Potter films as Petunia Dursley, Killing Eve as Carolyn Martens, and True Blood as Marnie. Shaw has also appeared in Enola Holmes, The Tree of Life, and The Black Dahlia. In Andor, she plays Cassian’s adoptive mother, Maarva Andor.</p><h2><strong>Syril Karn is played by Kyle Soller</strong></h2><p>Syril Karn, a glorified security guard with grandiose delusions, brings big hall monitor energy to the Star Wars galaxy. Instead of allowing crimes to take place in the “corporate sector” of space he patrols, as is the norm with Pre-Mor, Syril wishes to do some actual police work. It’s just a shame, as we learn in the third episode, that he’s also incredibly unprepared for a real fight. A complete loser.</p><p>Kyle Soller, who was born in the United States, studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and has appeared in several theatre productions on both sides of the Atlantic, winning an Olivier Award for his performance in The Inheritance. He’s also appeared on British television, including Poldark, An Inspector Calls, and Bounty Hunters. So far, his trip to a galaxy far, far away has been a very welcome addition, and we’re looking forward to seeing more of Syril. In episode 4, you’ll learn a little more about him.</p><h2><strong>Clem Andor is played by Gary Beadle</strong></h2><p>Clem Andor, Maarva’s partner in the flashbacks and Cassian’s adoptive father, is played by Gary Beadle. Cassian took Clem’s last name on Ferrix, and we learn from Luthen that Clem died sometime before the show.</p><p>Beadle is a British stage and television actor who is best known for his roles in EastEnders and Operation Good Guys. He’s also appeared in The Sarah Jane Adventures, Silent Witness, Grantchester, and, most recently, Persuasion 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvAp5uoql2YrrTAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bob-odenkirk-enjoyed-time-with-wife-kids-despite-his-son-s-covid-19-scare.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Odenkirk Enjoyed Time with Wife &amp;amp; Kids despite His Sons COVID-19 Scare">&larr;
