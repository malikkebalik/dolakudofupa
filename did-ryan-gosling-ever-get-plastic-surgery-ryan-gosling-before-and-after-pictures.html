He is known for his work in independent films, but he has also worked on blockbusters in many different genres. His worldwide box office earnings are over $1.9 billion USD. He has won a Golden Globe Award and been nominated for two Academy Awards and a BAFTA Award, among other honors.</p><h2>Ryan Gosling: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Gosling and his mixed-breed dog George used to live in New York City. He is a partner in a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, called Tagine. He bought the restaurant on a whim. He has said that he spent “all his money” on it, that he fixed it up himself for a year, and that he is now in charge of the menus.</p><p>From 2002 to 2003, Gosling was with<a href=# rel=noopener> Sandra Bullock</a>, who was also in the movie Murder by Numbers.&nbsp;Then, from 2005 to 2007, he was with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachel McAdams</a>, who was also in The Notebook. They briefly got back together in 2008.</p><p>Since September 2011, Gosling has been dating his co-star in The Place Beyond the Pines, Eva Mendes. The first daughter was born in 2014, and the second was born in 2016.</p><h2>Did Ryan Gosling Have Any Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Ryan Gosling, who is 41, already has a good face. The only thing that bothered him was the shape of his nose, which we’ve noticed since he was a child. He has a long nose with a thick bridge and a big bottom. This is not a good shape for an actor’s face, especially since the nose is such an important part of how a person looks as a whole. So, it’s clear that people in the entertainment business often change the shape of their noses.</p><p>Rhinoplasty turned out to make one of Hollywood’s most famous s*x symbols into a really handsome man. Look at the pictures of Ryan Gosling’s nose before and after it was fixed. The Canadian actor’s nose is now more pointed, and the bridge is straighter than it used to be.</p><p>At the start of his career, the bridge of his nose was much wider, and there was a big bump in the middle. After ten years, it looks like both of these things have changed.</p><p>But the star of “The Gray Man” doesn’t like to talk in-depth about his plastic <a href=#>surgery</a>. But the work that the plastic surgeons did on his face was amazing. Ryan Gosling’s nose job turned out very well, and he got all of the results he wanted. Also, the change affects his face as a whole because his nose looks much better now that it has been sculpted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ryan-gosling.jpg><p>When you look at the 41-year-old entertainer’s face, you don’t see a lot of wrinkles or sagging skin. And he doesn’t seem to have aged badly because his face doesn’t show any signs of it.</p><p>It’s possible that he got a gene that makes him more likely to get the aging sign. But he is in his forties, but his skin is perfect. Ryan Gosling doesn’t seem to have had any other plastic surgery besides the nose job.</p><h2>Are Ryan Gosling And Eva Mendes Still Married?</h2><p>Even though Gosling and <a href=# rel=noopener>Mendes</a> are not married, rumours about their wedding have been going around for years. Us Weekly said in 2016 that the couple got married in front of “a small group of family and friends,” but TMZ said that the story was not true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6fGorqMoKaspJmjtG6uxJ%2Bmq51dlrulecCfq56qXZmyta3IpapoamFog3d7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-rohrer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Rohrer">&larr;
