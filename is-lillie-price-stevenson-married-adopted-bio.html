Both her parents are successful celebrities, but sadly her mother is not in this world. Lillie&nbsp;has also appeared alongside her mother in several award shows and events.</p><p>Lillie's&nbsp;late mother, Kirstie Alley, was an award-winning American actress starring in several series and movies. She made her breakthrough with the role of Rebecca Howe in <i>Cheers</i>, an NBC sitcom. She won eight awards in her career, which includes two Primetime Emmys.&nbsp;</p><h2>Did You Know Lillie Price Stevenson Was Adopted?</h2><p>Yes, Lillie is adopted and her biological parents are not Parker and Kirstie. She was born in the United States on June 15, 1994, and was named after her great-grandmother, Granny Price. Any details about her biological parents haven't been disclosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/430fbf574a32e240aa738042e1cfcf91-1672208675101.jpg><p>Lillie was adopted just a year after she was born in 1995. Even though she was an adopted daughter, she still received the same care and affection from her parents as if she was their own blood.</p><p>With that much love and affection, Lillie couldn't ask for more. Being adopted into a rich and well-known family, she had no financial trouble growing up and had a blissful childhood.</p><h2>Lillie's Brother's Personal Details</h2><p>Lillie has had an older brother since her parents adopted <strong>William True Stevenson</strong> three years before they adopted Lillie. William was named after the grandfather of Kirstie, Clifford William Alley. He was first engaged to <strong>Lauren Sargeant </strong>when he was still in high school at the age of seventeen.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Lauren was a year older than William, but it didn't have any effect on their relationship. They had already been dating for a year before their engagement. It seems they separated after some time, but any details related to it haven't been revealed.</p><p>William has now married <strong>Sarah Parker</strong>, and the couple has given birth to three children. Two of the three children are daughters: Kit and Rebel. Their only son, Waylon Tripp Parker, was born in June 2016.</p><p><i>Similarly, </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Maria Burton Carson</i></a><i> was also an adopted child of the late actress Elizabeth Taylor.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Reason For Lillie And William's Adoption</h2><p>Lillie and William's mother, Kirstie, had struggled with her fertility. When she was just three months pregnant with Parker Stevenson, she suffered an unfortunate miscarriage. This deeply affected her emotionally and physically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/Kirstie-Alley-Children-01-120522-edda82ce1b0e43dc8756c85f5d61d043-1672208802245.jpg><p>As per <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>People</i></a>, she wrote in her book:</p><p>"When the baby was gone, I just didn't really get over it. Neither did my body. I so throughly convinced my body that it was still pregnant after nine months that I had milk coming from my breasts. I was still fat, I was still grieving, and I had just been told it was very possible I would never be able to have children."</p><h2>Lillie Lost Her First Love To An Accident</h2><p>When Lillie Price Stevenson was sixteen, she met <strong>Nick Trela</strong>, her first love, who was three years older than her. They were happily living together and had planned their wedding soon. Unfortunately, instead of a bright wedding ceremony, <a href=# rel=nofollow>a tragedy awaited</a> them.</p><p>During Nick Trela's motorcycle ride, reports indicate that he was involved in a collision with Justin Mikita's Audi. Justin Mikita, known as an actor, producer, and the spouse of renowned actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, was allegedly involved in the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Following an investigation, the attorney determined not to press charges of manslaughter against Justin. The judgment was influenced by the belief that Nick Trela's speeding played a role in the unfortunate event.</p><p>Obviously, the death of her finance left Lillie devastated. Many feared she would never fall in love again or start a family. Fortunately, she soon met the love of her life sometime later.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Also</i>,<i> check out the bio of </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Charles Levin</i></a><i>, who also died in a tragic accident.</i></p><h2>Kirstie Alley Daughter: Is Lillie Price Stevenson Married?</h2><p>Luckily soon after the tragic death of her first love, Lillie soon found love with <strong>Chaffee Burkhart Graham</strong>, a furniture maker. Although they haven't been officially married and recorded on paper, they got engaged near the end of 2016.</p><p>The happy couple Lillie and Chaffee gave birth to Ripp Woodrow Graham, their first child, on May 7, 2021. On Lillie's first Mother's Day, Chaffee called his wife the most beautiful mother he knew.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/DSC_0108-2-1672208921725.jpg><p>Lillie and Chaffee have started their own furniture company called <i>Parker Burkhart</i>. Although they are not officially married, Lillie has already changed her last name to Graham. She identifies as Lillie Parker Graham on the furniture company's <a href=# rel=nofollow>official website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Chaffee claims:</p><p>"Trying to put Ikea out of business one piece at a time."</p><h2>What's Lillie Price Stevenson's Net Worth?</h2><p>Kirstie Alley's daughter Lillie is now a co-owner of a furniture manufacturing company <i>Parker Burkhart</i>, with her husband, Chaffee Burkhart. She is often seen wearing a diamond ring that alone costs a ton of fortune.&nbsp;Lillie Price Stevenson's net worth is estimated to be approximately <strong>$750 thousand </strong>same as <a href=#><strong>Tomasa Guglielmi</strong></a>.</p><p>As for Lillie's&nbsp;mother, Kirstie Alley, she had a huge <strong>$40 million</strong> net worth. She also owned multiple mansions and property across the US. It's unclear how it will be distributed as the property, and the wealth left behind by her death is now ownerless.</p><h2>Why Was Lillie Price Stevenson's Parents' Divorce So Hyped?</h2><p>Lillie's mother, Kirstie Alley, known for her role as Ted Danson's love interest on the popular show "Cheers," faced a highly publicized divorce from her ex-husband and Lillie's adoptive father, Parker Stevenson in 1997. The couple grew apart after years together. The tabloids eagerly covered the divorce proceedings as Stevenson sought spousal support.</p><p>At the time of their separation, Alley and Stevenson had been married for 14 years. Stevenson, recognized for his roles in "Hardy Boys" and "Baywatch," revealed that he was used to a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>In his legal filings, Stevenson requested "sufficient support" to maintain a lifestyle equivalent to what they had during their marriage. Despite having once experienced some level of fame, Stevenson said that he did not anticipate ever reaching her level of income.</p><p>Ultimately, Stevenson agreed to a one-time settlement of $6 million, as reported by Forbes.com. This incident was highly publicized later.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Lillie Stevenson has gathered over <strong>5k </strong>followers on her Instagram account <a href=# rel=nofollow>@lillieparker</a>. She was also one of the first to break the news of her mother, Kirstie's death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/28/280237982_347236960631991_969405245712916150_n-1672209025422.jpg><p>Whether Lillie has any other social media accounts or not hasn't been revealed yet.
