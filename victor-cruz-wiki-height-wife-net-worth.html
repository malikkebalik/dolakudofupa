Cruz, a high school all-star athlete, was important to the University of Massachusetts. Cruz signed on with the New York Giants in 2010 after going undrafted. The next year, Cruz enjoyed a breakthrough season that helped the team win the Super Bowl and set a new club record for receiving yards.</strong></p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Victor_Cruz_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Victor Cruz? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Victor Cruz, an American football player, made $8.6 million in salary and had a fortune of <strong>$20 million as of December 2022.</strong> Cruz and the Giants agreed to a five-year, $43 million contract agreement in June 2013. He had just completed his inaugural Pro Bowl campaign. Cruz’s three-year, $1.215 million deal with the New York Giants in 2010 was also brought up.</p><p>Victor Cruz was an outstanding football player for the New York Giants who routinely helped his team win games. His career was plagued by several setbacks, including the death of his father, a subpar grade, and the selectors’ refusal to recognize him. He also had to go through pain.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Victor_Cruz_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Victor Cruz born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>On <strong>November 11, 1986,</strong> Victor Cruz was born in Paterson, New Jersey, in the USA. Victor Walker, the son of African-American firefighter Michael Walker and Puerto Rican-born Blanca Cruz, grew up in a drug- and gang-infested Paterson. Before this, he had said, “In the city, a lot of crime happened, a lot of violence happened occasionally,” and he later added, “Opportunities were few, especially for young guys of my race.” “Growing up in Patterson was not the simplest thing to do.”</p><p>His parents, who were never married and kept their son on a short leash, made sure he stayed out of trouble. Cruz’s mother and grandmother raised him most of the time, but his father gave him a lot of guidance and support, especially when it came to athletics.</p><p>When Cruz first enrolled at Paterson Catholic High School, he weighed just 165 pounds and stood 5’9″. He was an important player on the football field as a receiver and a kick returner.</p><p>However, because of his poor college grades, he was not given the chance to apply for any scholarships. Cruz attended Bridgton Academy in Maine after receiving his diploma in 2004 and spent a postgraduate year there to raise his academic standing and continue his football career.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:414px;width:100%><tbody><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Celebrated Name:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Victor Cruz</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Real Name/Full Name:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Victor Michael Cruz</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Male</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Age:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>35 years old</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Birth Date:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>11 November 1986</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Birth Place:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Paterson, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>American</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Height:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>1.83 m</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Weight:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>93 kg</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Straight</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Marital Status:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>In a relationship</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Wife/Spouse (Name):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>N/A</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Children/Kids (Son and Daughter):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Yes (Kennedy Cruz)</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Dating/Girlfriend (Name):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Yes (Elaina Watley m. 2003; div. 2014), Karrueche Tran (m. 2017)</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Is&nbsp;</strong><strong>Victor Cruz Gay?:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>No</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>American football wide receiver, Analyst</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Salary:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>N/A</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Net Worth in 2022:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>$20 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Victor_Cruz_Single_Relationship>Is Victor Cruz Single?

Cruz and Elaina Watley were married and had a kid together, but following their split, Cruz started dating Karrueche Tran. The “Young Whales” clothing brand was introduced by Cruz and his former coworker Nate Collins in the summer of 2010. Among the initial models for the business were Cruz and Osi Umenyiora, former colleagues. Cruz understood the value of having a rich life after his father’s untimely suicide.</p><p>Cruz paid respect to Jack Pinto, a 6-year-old victim of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. Pinto was smitten with Cruz. After the massacre, Cruz paid honor to his footwear during the game against the Atlanta Falcons. Cruz used permanent markers to write “Jack Pinto My Hero” and “R.I.P. Jack Pinto” on each of his sneakers.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Victor_Cruz_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Victor Cruz?

In the hopes that he would be healthy enough to play the following season, the football team decided to give him a redshirt that year.</p><p>Cruz’s poor performance forced him to leave the school, return to Paterson to regroup, and enroll in courses at a neighboring community college to raise his college grades. Cruz realized he had to step up as the head of the household and begin treating his life seriously after his father’s untimely suicide.</p><p>Victor had good numbers but was not picked in the 2010 NFL Draft. Cruz received interest from several teams as a free agent, but he ultimately decided to sign with the New York Giants, his hometown team. But his chance at a successful debut season was lost. Cruz suffered a serious hamstring injury in 2010, which required him to miss most of the campaign.</p><p>In the NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers, Cruz hauled in ten catches for 142 yards. Cruz then assisted the Giants in their Super Bowl XLVI victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.</p><p>Cruz announced his retirement on August 21, 2018, and he afterward started working as an analyst for ESPN. He had to sign a one-day contract with the New York Giants to legally retire from the team.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Footballer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Dominik Livakovic | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Dominik Livakovic is a Croatian professional footballer.
