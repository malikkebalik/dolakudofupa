He was a guest host on the show Have you been paying attention? as well.</strong></p><p>Cumpston was born on May 29, 1999, and he was reared in his native Australia. The Twins, or Gemini, are Cumpston’s natal zodiac sign. Even though he’s just starting out, his acting skills have earned him widespread recognition.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Hal_Cumpston_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Hal Cumpston? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Actor Hal Cumpston is on the up and up, having won a number of awards previously. It is reasonable to presume that he makes a comfortable livelihood as a result of his participation in successful ventures.</p><p>It is believed that he has a net worth of $550,000. His acting credits include The Walking Dead: World Beyond, Nine Perfect Strangers, and The Greatest Beer Run Ever.</p><p>Additionally, Jeremy, Hal’s dad, is reported to be worth $5 million, while Hal’s mom is worth $1 million.</p><h2><span id=Cumpston_played_cricket_for_his_high_school>Cumpston played cricket for his high school</span></h2><p>While at Waverly College, Hal participated in cricket. His academic credentials are up for debate, but it’s common knowledge that he bowled exceptionally well.</p><p>He also won the title for the best bowler in the third team’s cricket match in 2017. When he found out he had won this award, Cumpston was ecstatic.</p><h2><span id=Is_Hal_Cumpston_Single_Relationship>Is Hal Cumpston Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Hal Cumpton has been coy about his personal life. It would appear that the Australian actor resides alone. He hasn’t introduced his partner to anyone outside of their own circle.</p><p>On the other hand, a snapshot Cumpton shared on Instagram with Maddie Sherston has sparked rumors that the two are romantically involved.</p><h2><span id=Parents_and_Children>Parents and Children</span></h2><p>In Australia, the Cumptons are a prominent family. Both of his parents have jobs in the media. Both his father, Jeremy Cumpston, and mother, Rachel Lane, are in the entertainment industry. Additionally, Jeremy is a medical doctor.</p><p>His parents have had a significant impact on both his personal and professional development. They’ve always supported their kid in following his heart.</p><h2><span id=His_Father_Jeremy_Cumpston>His Father Jeremy Cumpston</span></h2><p>Jeremy Cumpston, Hal’s dad, has a dual career as an actor and a doctor. He became famous for his role as Conor Costello on All Saints.</p><p>The 10th of January marks Jeremy’s birthday because that’s when he was born in 1967. His parents split their time between Australia and Canada while raising him and his four siblings. His father was a physician, therefore the family frequently relocated between Canada and Australia.</p><p>Like his father before him, Cumpston chose a medical profession for himself. He followed in his father’s footsteps by studying medicine, but he knew all along that acting was his calling. Therefore, he started taking acting lessons after finishing his internship at Prince Henry’s Hospital.</p><p>Hugh Jackman, Jason Clarke, and the actor from All Saints were all students at the same acting school. In 1992, with the film Hidden Injuries, Jeremy made his acting debut. He has appeared in 13 films, some of which are The Mystery of Natalie Woods and What If It Works?</p><p>During his time as a doctor, Cumpston oversaw the expansion of his cosmetic clinic network, Ageless Clinics, throughout the state of New South Wales. His current license to practice medicine expires in 2020, and before renewing it, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) has demanded proof of sufficient professional indemnity insurance from him.</p><h2><span id=Rachel_Lane_Mother>Rachel Lane, Mother</span></h2><p>Cumpston’s mom is the famous I Can Hear Ice Cream maker Rachel Lane. She doesn’t like it when others talk about her behind her back, therefore she keeps a lot of things secret.</p><p>Lane and Cumpston were previously married but later separated. However, they are on good terms and share parenting of Hal.</p><h2><span id=The_Father_of_Hal8217s_Two_Spouses>The Father of Hal’s Two Spouses</span></h2><p>Jeremy, Cumpston’s father, has been married multiple times. His first wife was the producer Rachel Lane. Together, they raised Hal. Their romance ended badly, unfortunately.</p><p>Since 2005, Jeremy has been married to producer Jessica Brentnall. Her portrayal of Aurora in “Sleeping Beauty” is what made her famous.</p><p>For Cumpston, Charlie Brucato has doubled as the stuntman.</p><p>Most famous people hire a stunt double when they need to film a scene that requires dangerous physical activity. They have a body double, and so does Cumpston.</p><p>Charlie Brucato, who plays the part of Cumpston, does a number of dangerous feats. He included Brucato in several Instagram posts.</p><h2><span id=Cumpston_is_continuing_his_family_tradition>Cumpston is continuing his family tradition</span></h2><p>Cumpston’s early interest in acting was inspired by his admiration for his father’s career. He had always dreamed of being a famous actor and a major player in the entertainment business.</p><p>His father’s most recent role was as a talk show host in the short film Stuntbot, set to be released in 2020. Cumpston has worked on Bilched alongside his dad, too.</p><p>Like his father, Cumpston has been a successful writer and producer.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Cumpston wrote and produced the 2019 feature Bilched.</p><p>He has one credit in every category on his IMDb page. The movie Bilched has work from all of his relatives. His mother, Rachel, produced it, and his father, who acted in it, was Cumpston.</p><h2><span id=Awards_and_Nominations>Awards and Nominations</span></h2><p>In recognition of his work on Bilched, Cumpston has won the honors for Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, and Grand Prix Best Feature Film.</p><p>This recognition helped him become where he is today professionally. After that, he was considered for the role of Silas in The Walking Dead: World Beyond.</p><h2><span id=The_Walking_Dead_World_Beyond_Silas_Plaskett>The Walking Dead: World Beyond, Silas Plaskett</span></h2><p>Cumpston’s performance as Silas Plaskett has been spot-on. The character sketches paint him as a timid Janitor in the neighborhood. But when rumors of his horrible nature spread, people gradually start to avoid him. To establish his innocence, he visits the undead.</p><p>As a result of his performance, Hal has gained a sizable fan base. He’s also developed into a major player in the series.</p><h2><span id=A_Group_of_Nine_Random_People>A Group of Nine Random People</span></h2><p>In Nine Perfect Strangers, nine overworked city people check into a posh health spa that claims to be a place of renewal and reinvention. The resort’s director is a lady with the goal to refresh their weary spirits and bodies.</p><p>In the show, Hal plays the role of Zach Marconi. The death of her brother Zach affected Zoe Marconi deeply.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Cumpston is constantly updating his social media profiles. He takes pleasure in keeping his loved ones apprised of his whereabouts. He is active on every major social media site.</p><p>The con artist actor has over 11,000 Instagram followers under the username @Halcumpston. He has shared personal and business information on this social media site.</p><p>Similarly, he is buddies with 1,200 people on Facebook. In addition, a Twitter account with his name has been spotted, albeit it is not known if it actually belongs to him.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Rafael Almeida</a></h3>Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Rafael Almeida's Estimated Net Worth, Age, Biography, Career, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki.
