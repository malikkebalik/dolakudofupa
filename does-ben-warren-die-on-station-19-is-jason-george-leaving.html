However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine Station 19 without Ben Warren, which is why a new promo has fans worried about the firefighter’s fate. Does <a href=# rel=noopener>Ben Warren die on Station 19</a>? Keep reading to find out.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Station 19</a> is a spin-off of <a href=# rel=noopener>Grey’s Anatomy</a> that follows the personal and professional lives of firefighters at the Seattle Fire Department’s fictional Station 19, from the captain to the newest recruit. The main character is Andrea “Andy” Herrera, the newly appointed captain of Station 19 and the stubborn daughter of the late Captain Pruitt Herrera. Executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, the series premiered in 2018 and is currently on its <a href=# rel=noopener>seventh and final season</a>.</p><p>Ben Warren (played by Jason George) was first introduced during Season 6 of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Grey’s Anatomy</a> as an attending anesthesiologist who transferred from Mercy West Medical Center to Seattle Grace when the two hospitals merged. He went on to become a surgical resident at Grey Sloan Memorial and eventually got married to Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). He left the show in Season 14 after deciding that he was unhappy with surgery and wanted to become a firefighter. Ben has been a staple on the spin-off series ever since, and he frequently appears on both shows during crossover episodes.</p><p>The upcoming Season 7 episode “My Way” will see the Station 19 squad face a life-or-death emergency at the Space Needle, Seattle’s most iconic landmark. The promo has fans worried that not everyone will make it out alive, namely Ben Warren. Here’s everything to know about the beloved character’s future on the show.</p><h2>Does Ben Warren die on Station 19?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ben-Warren-Station-19-3.jpg alt="Ben Warren, Station 19" width=1366 height=797 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Along with the other firefighters at Station 19, Ben Warren’s life has been at risk many times. However, a new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">promo</a> for the fifth episode of Season 7 suggests that the danger Ben finds himself in his time could be fatal.</p><p>The episode’s official synopsis reads, “Andy Herrera earns her captain’s stripes as she fearlessly leads her team during a life-or-death emergency at Seattle’s most beloved landmark.” While responding to the call at the Space Needle, Ben issues a frantic mayday alert and claims that all of the exits are blocked by fire. He can then be heard yelling: “There’s no way out!” The the clip concludes with Ben asking his team to a relay a message to his wife. “Tell Miranda she was worth waiting for,” Ben says.</p><p>Fans have been in a tizzy over the promo and are very worried about his fate. “‘Tell Miranda she was worth waiting for…’ OH MY GOD- if they hurt Ben Warren i will not survive!!” one fan wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. “I<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">f y’all touch </span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q">Ben Warren</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">… leave him alone! Miranda does not deserve it. Pru can’t lose another father. @Station19 </span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">writers, please don’t do it to us. Go rewrite the storyline right now. Ben better be good by the end of tomorrow’s episode #Station19,” another fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">wrote,</a> referencing Pru Miller, the daughter of late firefighter Dean Miller whom Ben and Miranda took in.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Although things look grim for Ben, he will most likely not die. Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;showrunner&nbsp;Meg Marinis has already hinted that the beloved character will continue to exist in the Grey’s universe even after Station 19‘s final chapter concludes. “What I can tell you is that the Bailey and Ben relationship will continue to cross over,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>. “Those two actors love crossing over and it’s very important to them that what they do over here and what they do over there, that it’s one symbiotic thing.”</p><p>Ben may survive this life-or-death emergency, but that does not mean he won’t be critically injured.&nbsp;In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a>, Jaina Lee Ortiz, who stars as Andy Herrera, teased a “<a href=# rel=noopener>crazy crossover</a>” between Grey’s and Station 19 toward the end of their respective seasons. “I have a feeling there’s going to be a major crossover towards the end of the season. And this character has never visited&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy in this way,” she said. Out of all of the Station 19 characters, Ben pops up on the medical drama the most, so it’s very possible that he is the character in question. Perhaps he needs emergency surgery and is rushed to Grey Sloan Memorial. Ben’s safety is one of the main topics that he and Miranda discuss, with the latter constantly worried about him. A near-death experience would put Miranda through the ringer, but it would make sense for the couple’s storyline.</p><p>Another Station 19 member who could be at risk is Sean Beckett (Josh Randall). In the promo, he is seen falling from what looks like an elevator shaft and Maya Bishop (Danielle Savre) can be heard yelling into her walkie talkie: “Beckett report!”</p><p>Station 19 airs on ABC on Thursdays at 8/7c and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Station 19, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>the cast’s real-life partners</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmp%2FdHyOm5ynZaeWv7OxzWabop1dqMGiwMiopWZpaWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./guardian-quick-betrayal-crossword-clue-betrayal-answer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guardian Quick Betrayal Crossword Clue, Betrayal Answer">&larr;
