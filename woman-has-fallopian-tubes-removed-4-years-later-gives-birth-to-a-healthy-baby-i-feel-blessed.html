Hers was the first documented case that resulted in a healthy, viable baby.</p><p class=Fg>Life is a beautiful journey filled with endless moments of surprise, wonder, and joy. Every day presents us with brand new opportunities and a chance to practice gratitude and grace.</p><p class=Fg>Three years ago, a woman's life changed when she experienced a miracle unlike anything else in an unimaginable twist of fate. She felt a range of emotions, including shock and confusion, but her tremendous happiness overshadowed them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/874659e6793a55a3679b78e943c25b4d.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Elizabeth Kough with her son, Benjamin [Left]. A close-up of baby Benjamin [Right]. | Photo: youtube.com/GMA | twitter.com/InsideEdition</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A SINGLE MOM-OF-THREE</strong></p><p class=Fg>Elizabeth Kough from Kearney, Missouri, was divorced, single, and a mother to three adorable kids. She felt blessed to have a beautiful family and a loving home resounding with her children's laughter.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>In 2015, the then-35-year-old Kough decided to have both fallopian tubes removed for several reasons.</strong></p><p class=Fg>Kough underwent a surgical procedure, bilateral salpingectomy, medically proven to reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer, a condition that ran in her family.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>UNDERGOING THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE</strong></p><p class=Fg>"I also hit age 35 and they medically say at that age pregnancy becomes more high-risk," <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/miracle-baby-born-mom-fallopian-tubes-removed-63715481>explained</a> Kough. As a divorced, single mom-of-three, the Missouri woman felt her family was complete.</p><h3 class=Kg>Years later, she gave birth to her seventh child, proving that miracles happen when we least expect them.</h3><p class=Fg>Kough's OB-GYN in Virginia performed the procedure, which was an almost foolproof method of contraception. Three years passed, and Kough found love again. <strong class=Dg>After entering into a relationship, she moved to Missouri with her children.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0b3c2b63ed51b90ee69d6701c360ec0a.png><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Elizabeth Kough with her son, Benjamin. | Photo: YouTube.com/GMA</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THE SHOCKING REVELATION</strong></p><p class=Fg>Then, one day, in 2018, she started feeling pregnancy symptoms. Kough took a home pregnancy test to rule out her doubts, and the results were positive. She was flabbergasted and immediately called her boyfriend, who drove her to a nearby hospital.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>The blood test and ultrasound confirmed that Kough was expecting her fourth baby.</strong> Her case reflected chances of an ectopic pregnancy, where a fertilized egg attaches itself outside the womb.</p><p class=Fg>Astonishingly, Kough's baby was developing inside her uterus. Everyone, including her doctors, was dumbfounded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d7c395effe300f477820e63c321ebbb2.png><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Elizabeth Kough. | Photo: YouTube.com/GMA</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WELCOME, BABY BENJAMIN</strong></p><p class=Fg>Dr. Dawn Heizman, a board-certified OB-GYN at Meritas Health, who reviewed Kough's case, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://abc13.com/elizabeth-kough-fallopian-tubes-miracle-baby-dr-dawn-heizman/5352896/>revealed</a> <strong class=Dg>the scenario was unheard of, and they had never encountered it before.</strong></p><p class=Fg>Some doctors believed that an egg migrated to her uterine horns, where the fallopian tubes were once attached, and entered via a fistula to reach her uterus.</p><p class=Fg>Dr. Heizman mentioned that only three pregnancies after removing fallopian tubes were documented, but Kough's case was the first that resulted in a healthy birth. <strong class=Dg>Kough delivered baby Benjamin in March 2019, weighing seven pounds, six ounces.</strong></p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>"I FEEL BLESSED"</strong></p><p class=Fg>The doctors even checked during delivery and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7159103/First-baby-born-mom-fallopian-tubes-removed-having-three-children.html>confirmed</a> that Kough's fallopian tubes were removed and she didn't get pregnant via IVF. Dr. <strong class=Dg>Heizman expressed it was a miracle for Kough to deliver a healthy child under such rare circumstances.</strong></p><p class=Fg>Even shocking was that Kough's otherwise high-risk pregnancy proceeded smoothly, and her son was born via C-section. "After I first found out I was pregnant, I bought so many lottery tickets because I thought, 'I'm so lucky,'" <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/-erIxFOt9pQ>recalled</a> Kough.</p><p class=Fg>The mother-of-four called her youngest child, Benjamin, her angel baby. She also <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-erIxFOt9pQ">added:</a> "When I look at him I feel really blessed to have him because I know the chances of him being here are just so slim.<strong class=Dg> I hug him even tighter."</strong></p><p class=Fg>Something similar unfolded for a Tennessee woman who was told she couldn't have children. Years later, she gave birth to her seventh child, proving that miracles happen when we least expect them.
