He is the eldest son of Sam Walton, the man who founded Walmart. As of the year 2022, Rob Walton’s net worth is estimated to be $68 billion.</p><p>Rob Walton, who is also an heir to the Walton fortune, was Chairman of Walmart from 1992 to 2015 and was a key figure in the company’s day-to-day operations for much of that time.</p><p>This sets him different from his brothers and fellow heirs, as very few of them have ever been employed within the business of Walmart. This gives him an advantage over his siblings and fellow heirs. Rob has consistently ranked among the top 15 wealthiest people on the planet in recent years.</p><p>Rob Walton maintains a low profile and rarely participates in media appearances, despite the staggering amount of money he is worth. Because of this, there is not a lot of information available concerning his personal life. In this way, a good number of the other Walton heirs are identical to one other.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Traci Braxton Net Worth 2022: Early Life, Music Career, And Traci Braxton Net Worth At The Time Of Her Death</a></p><h2>Rob Walton Net Worth 2022</h2><table class=celeb_stats_table><tbody><tr class=row-fill><td>Net Worth:</td><td>$68 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>Oct 28, 1944 (77 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>United States of America</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Rob Walton Early Life</h2><p>Robson, Samuel “Rob” Walton was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 28th, 1944.

During the 1980s, Walmart grew enormously powerful, and Sam Walton was once considered the richest man on the planet. Since then, Walmart has expanded all over the world.</p><p>Rob Walton went to The University of Arkansas after graduating from college. Walton obtained a bachelor of science in business administration after entering in 1966. He was also initiated into the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.
